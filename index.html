        <h4>
        Maternal Side
        </h4>
        My mother's side of the family is primarily from Norway, a country in Northern Europe. It is believed that some of our ancestors were Vikings. My first name came from my Norwegian great grandmother also named Cora.

        <h4>
        Paternal Side
        </h4>
        My father's side of the family is more spread out. His family mostly came from Israel initially but then spread to Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine and slightly in Russia. My last name comes from this side of the family. It was initially something longer, but was shorted when they got to America.

            Activities I'm currently in are tennis, sailing, and ice skating. Tennis I do from late February to November at a tennis court nearr my house. I do sailing in the summer at my yacht club. There we sail 420 sailboats and the younger kids sail in bugs. In previous years optis also got sailed in. I go ice skating in the winter from December to February. I skate at a rink near my house that used to be the location of the Ferris Wheel at the World's Fair.

            </h3>
            <h4>Physical Goal</h4>
            One physical goal I've been working on is getting more fit and working out every morning. I've been successful for multiple months and I want to work to continue that.
            <h4>Emotional Goal</h4>
            An emotional goal I have is to become more independent. That involves getting better at doing chores like laundry and dishwashing. I'll try to help more around the house to accomplish those.
            <h4>Social Goal</h4>
            A social goal I have is to make more friends who sail so I can go sailing with friends. To accomplish that I'm going to continue with different sailing programs that are available.
